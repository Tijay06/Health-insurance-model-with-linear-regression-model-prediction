Medical Insurance Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting medical insurance prices based on various parameters. The project encompasses the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted comprehensive data analysis to gather higher-level insights from the health insurance dataset.

Data Visualization: Created visualizations to understand the dataset better and assess the relationships between parameters.

Data Preprocessing: Applied preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data for modeling.

Data Wrangling: Handled data wrangling tasks to ensure the dataset was in optimal shape for analysis.

Model Deployment: Utilized a variety of regression models, including:

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
This involved:

Imputation of missing values using SimpleImputer
Training and evaluating models with train_test_split and cross_val_score
Model Performance Visualization: Visualized model performance metrics to assess accuracy and effectiveness.

Model Saving: Saved the trained model for future predictions.

Prediction: Used the saved model to predict insurance prices on a new dataset.
