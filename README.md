<h1>Medical Insurance Price Prediction using Machine Learning: </h1> 
<p>This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting medical insurance prices based on various parameters. The project encompasses the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted comprehensive data analysis to gather higher-level insights from the health insurance dataset.</p>

<ol>
<li>Data Visualization: Created visualizations to understand the dataset better and assess the relationships between parameters.
</li>

<li>Data Preprocessing: Applied preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data for modeling.</li>

<li>Data Wrangling: Handled data wrangling tasks to ensure the dataset was in optimal shape for analysis.</li>

<li>Model Deployment: Utilized a variety of regression models, including:</li>
<p>
<p>Linear Regression</p>
Lasso Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
This involved:

Imputation of missing values using SimpleImputer
Training and evaluating models with train_test_split and cross_val_score
Model Performance Visualization: Visualized model performance metrics to assess accuracy and effectiveness.
</p>

<li>Model Saving: Saved the trained model for future predictions.</li>

<li>Prediction: Used the saved model to predict insurance prices on a new dataset.</li>
</ol>

<p>Explore the repository to understand the implementation and see how different models perform in predicting medical insurance prices.
